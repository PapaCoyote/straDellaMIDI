# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: BUILD FILES MUST BE REGENERATED ⚠️

## Build files are NOT included in this repository!

### Why is this needed?

The `straDellaMIDI.jucer` project file is the **source of truth** for the project. The platform-specific build files (Xcode projects, Visual Studio solutions, Makefiles) are **generated by Projucer** and should not be committed to version control.

This is standard practice for JUCE projects because:
- Different developers may have different JUCE installations
- Build files can be regenerated in seconds
- Keeps the repository clean and avoids merge conflicts
- Ensures everyone builds with the correct plugin configuration

### Current State

🚫 **Builds/MacOSX/** - Build files removed (must be generated with Projucer)
✅ **straDellaMIDI.jucer** - Audio Plugin configuration (AU + VST3)

### What happens if you try to build without regenerating?

You **cannot** build without regenerating! The Xcode project files don't exist in the repository. You must generate them with Projucer first.

If you previously had old build files and tried to build without regenerating, you would have gotten:
- ❌ A standalone GUI application (.app) - **8KB .component file**
- ❌ A huge unlinked static library (libstraDellaMIDI.a - 177MB)
- ❌ NOT proper VST3 or AU plugins

This is exactly the issue described in the problem statement!

### How to Fix: Regenerate Build Files

#### Option 1: Using Projucer (Recommended)

1. **Install JUCE and Projucer**
   - Download from [juce.com](https://juce.com/)
   
2. **Open the .jucer file in Projucer**
   ```bash
   Projucer straDellaMIDI.jucer
   ```
   Or double-click `straDellaMIDI.jucer` if Projucer is your default app

3. **Configure Global Paths**
   - In Projucer: File → Global Paths
   - Set path to your JUCE modules directory

4. **Save/Export the Project**
   - Click "Save Project" or press Cmd+S (macOS) / Ctrl+S (Windows)
   - This regenerates all build files in `Builds/`

5. **Build the Plugin**
   - Now open `Builds/MacOSX/straDellaMIDI.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Build targets will include:
     - straDellaMIDI (AU plugin)
     - straDellaMIDI (VST3 plugin)
   
#### Option 2: Using Projucer Command Line

```bash
# Navigate to Projucer binary location
cd /Applications/JUCE/Projucer.app/Contents/MacOS/

# Regenerate build files
./Projucer --resave /path/to/straDellaMIDI/straDellaMIDI.jucer
```

### After Regeneration

Once you've regenerated the build files, you'll see:
- ✅ Info-VST3.plist (for VST3 plugin)
- ✅ Info-AU.plist (for Audio Unit plugin)
- ✅ Proper plugin build targets in Xcode
- ✅ Plugin bundle outputs (.vst3 and .component)

### Verification

After regenerating and building, check that you get:
```
Builds/MacOSX/build/Release/
├── straDellaMIDI.component    (AU plugin)
└── straDellaMIDI.vst3         (VST3 plugin)
```

NOT:
```
❌ straDellaMIDI.app  (standalone GUI app - old)
```

### Plugin Formats Enabled

The project is now configured to build:
- ✅ **AU (Audio Unit)** - Native macOS format, best for Logic Pro
- ✅ **VST3** - Cross-platform format

### Next Steps

1. Regenerate build files with Projucer (see above)
2. Build the plugin with Xcode
3. Install to:
   - AU: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/straDellaMIDI.component`
   - VST3: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/straDellaMIDI.vst3`
4. Launch Logic Pro and scan for new plugins
5. Add straDellaMIDI as a MIDI FX plugin

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I built but still got a .app file?**  
A: You didn't regenerate the build files. Follow the steps above.

**Q: Projucer says "Invalid JUCE modules path"?**  
A: Go to File → Global Paths and set the correct path to your JUCE modules.

**Q: Build fails with missing AU headers?**  
A: Make sure you have Xcode with Audio Unit SDK installed.
